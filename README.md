## What this is

Originally created to be a page where I can learn about static sites, it
has grown to be my main resume page.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Vite Starter Template](https://github.com/samhwang/vite-starter-template)
and hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

## Using this as a resume template

- Clone this repo.
- Update the metadata in `metadata/metadata.ts`, and it will be reflected in the resume components of the site.

## Built with

### Language

- TypeScript and React
- SASS pre-processor for CSS

### Tools

- Vite build tool
- Vitest for testing
- Netlify for static site hosting and CI/CD
